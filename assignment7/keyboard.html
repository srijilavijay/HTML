      <h1>What is Keyboard?</h1>
      <p>
        A keyboard is one of the primary input devices that allows users to
        input text into a computer or any other electronic machinery. It is a
        peripheral device that is the most basic way for the user to communicate
        with a computer. It consists of multiple buttons, which create numbers,
        symbols, and letters, and special keys like the Windows and Alt key,
        including performing other functions. The design of the keyboard comes
        from the typewriter keyboards, and numbers and letters are arranged on
        the keyboard in that way, which helps to type quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The above keyboard design is called QWERTY design because of its first
        six letters across in the upper-left-hand corner of the keyboard.
        Although the keyboard design is derived from the typewrites, nowadays,
        it also includes many other keys as well as Alt/Option, Control, and
        Windows key can be used as shortcuts to perform the particular operation
        by combination with other keys. For example, if you press Control + S
        while working on a document in Microsoft Word, it will save the document
        you are working on. Furthermore, most of the keyboards have function
        keys (F1 to F12 or F16) at the top of the keyboard and arranged arrow
        keys in the downside used to perform numerous functions.

      <h2>Invention of the first keyboard?</h2>
      <p>
        There were different types of invention, as well as the typewriter,
        keypunches, and teleprinters that helped to develop the computer
        keyboard. In the 1700s, the first writing devices were designed, and
        Henry Mills filed patented in London, England, in 1714.

      <h2>Invention of the typewriter</h2>
      <p>
        The different typing and writing devices were created around the world
        in the late 1700s and the beginning of the 1800s. Although, in 1868,
        Christopher Sholes developed and patented the first practical typewriter
        and the word Type-Writer that is considered to be the first typewriter.
        Additionally, the QWERTY keyboard design was introduced by the
        Type-Writer, which is still mainly used on US keyboards today. Samuel W.
        Soule, Christopher Sholes, and Carlos Glidden created a Type-Writer that

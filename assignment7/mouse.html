      <h1>Mouse</h1>
      <p>
        The mouse is a hand-held input device which is used to move cursor or
        pointer across the screen. It is designed to be used on a flat surface
        and generally has left and right button and a scroll wheel between them.
        Laptop computers come with a touchpad that works as a mouse. It lets you
        control the movement of cursor or pointer by moving your finger over the
        touchpad. Some mouse comes with integrated features such as extra
        buttons to perform different buttons. The mouse was invented by Douglas
        C. Engelbart in 1963. Early mouse had a roller ball integrated as a
        movement sensor underneath the device. Modern mouse devices come with
        optical technology that controls cursor movements by a visible or
        invisible light beam. A mouse is connected to a computer through
        different ports depending on the type of computer and type of a mouse.

      <h3>Common types of the mouse:</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>i) Trackball Mouse:</dt>
        <dd>
          It is a stationary input device that has ball mechanism to move the
          pointer or cursor on the screen. The ball is half inserted in the
          device and can be easily rolled with finger, thumb or the palm to move
          the pointer on the screen. The device has sensor to detect the
          rotation of ball. It remains stationary; you don't need to move it on
          the operating surface. So, it is an ideal device if you have limited
          desk space as you don't need to move it like a mouse.
        </dd>
        <dt>ii) Mechanical Mouse:</dt>
        <dd>
          It has a system of a ball and several rollers to track its movement.
          It is a corded type of mouse. A mechanical mouse can be used for high
          performance. The drawback is that they tend to get dust into the
          mechanics and thus require regular cleaning.
        </dd>
        <dt>iii) Optical Mouse:</dt>
        <dd>
          An optical mouse uses optical electronics to track its movement. It is
          more reliable than a mechanical mouse and also requires less
          maintenance. However, its performance is affected by the surface on
          which it is operated. Plain non-glossy mouse mat should be used for
          best results. The rough surface may cause problems for the optical
          recognition system, and the glossy surface may reflect the light
          wrongly and thus may cause tracking issues.
        </dd>
        <dt>iv) Cordless or Wireless Mouse:</dt>
        <dd>
          As the name suggests, this type of mouse lacks cable and uses wireless
          technology such as IrDA (infrared) or radio (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) to
          control the movement of the cursor. It is used to improve the
          experience of using a mouse. It uses batteries for its power supply.

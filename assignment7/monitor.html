      <h1>Monitor</h1>
      <p>
        The monitor is the display unit or screen of the computer. It is the
        main output device that displays the processed data or information as
        text, images, audio or video.
      </p>
      <p>The types of monitors are given below.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>i) CRT Monitor</dt>
        <dd>
          CRT monitors are based on the cathode ray tubes. They are like vacuum
          tubes which produce images in the form of video signals. Cathode rays
          tube produces a beam of electrons through electron guns that strike on
          the inner phosphorescent surface of the screen to produce images on
          the screen. The monitor contains millions of phosphorus dots of red,
          green and blue color. These dots start to glow when struck by electron
          beams and this phenomenon is called cathodoluminescence. The main
          components of a CRT monitor include the electron gun assembly,
          deflection plate assembly, fluorescent screen, glass envelope, and
          base. <br />The front (outer surface) of the screen onto which images
          are produced is called the face plate. It is made up of fiber optics.
          There are three electron beams that strike the screen: red, green, and
          blue. So, the colors which you see on the screen are the blends of
          red, blue and green lights.The magnetic field guides the beams of
          electrons. Although LCDs have replaced the CRT monitors, the CRT
          monitors are still used by graphics professionals because of their
          color quality.

        <dt>ii) LCD Monitor</dt>
        <dd>
          The LCD monitor is a flat panel screen that is compact and
          light-weight as compared to CRT monitors. It is based on liquid
          crystal display technology which is used in the screens of laptops,
          tablets, smart phones, etc. An LCD screen comprises two layers of
          polarized glass with a liquid crystal solution between them. When the
          light passes through the first layer, an electric current aligns the
          liquids crystals. The aligned liquid crystals allow a varying level of
          light to pass through the second layer to create images on the screen.
          <br />
          The LCD screen has a matrix of pixels that display the image on the
          screen.Old LCDs had passive-matrix screens in which individual pixels
          are controlled by sending a charge. A few electrical charges could be
          sent each second that made screens appear blurry when the images moved
          quickly on the screen. <br />
          Modern LCDs use active-matrix technology and contain thin film
          transistors (TFTs) with capacitors. This technology allows pixels to
          retain their charge. So, they don?t make screen blurry when images
          move fast on the screen as well as are more efficient than
          passive-matrix displays.

        <dt>iii) LED monitor</dt>
        <dd>
          The LED monitor is an improved version of an LCD monitor. It also has
          a flat panel display and uses liquid crystal display technology like
          the LCD monitors. The difference between them lies in the source of
          light to backlight the display. The LED monitor has many LED panels,
          and each panel has several LEDsto backlight the display, whereas the
          LCD monitors use cold cathode fluorescent light to backlight the
          display.Modern electronic devices such as mobile phones, LED TVs,
          laptop and computer screens, etc., use a LED display as it not only
          produces more brilliance and greater light intensity but also consumes
          less power.

        <dt>iv) Plasma Monitor</dt>
        <dd>
          The plasma monitor is also a flat panel display that is based on
          plasma display technology. It has small tiny cells between two glass
          panels. These cells contain mixtures of noble gases and a small amount
          of mercury. When voltage is applied, the gas in the cells turns into a
          plasma and emits ultraviolet light that creates images on the screen,
          i.e., the screen is illuminated by a tiny bit of plasma, a charged
          gas. Plasma displays are brighter than liquid crystal displays (LCD)
          and also offer a wide viewing angle than an LCD. <br />Plasma monitors
          provide high resolutions of up to 1920 X 1080, excellent contrast
          ratios, wide viewing angle, a high refresh rate and more. Thus, they
          offer a unique viewing experience while watching action movies, sports
          games, and more.

      <h1>Scanner</h1>
      <p>
        The scanner uses the pictures and pages of text as input. It scans the
        picture or a document. The scanned picture or document then converted
        into a digital format or file and is displayed on the screen as an
        output. It uses optical character recognition techniques to convert
        images into digital ones. Some of the common types of scanners are as
        follows:

      <h3>Types of Scanner:</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>i) Flatbed Scanner:</dt>
        <dd>
          It has a glass pane and a moving optical CIS or CCD array. The light
          illuminates the pane, and then the image is placed on the glass pane.
          The light moves across the glass pane and scans the document and thus
          produces its digital copy. You will need a transparency adapter while
          scanning transparent slides.
        </dd>

        <dt>ii) Handheld Scanner:</dt>
        <dd>
          It is a small manual scanning device which is held by hand and is
          rolled over a flat image that is to be scanned. The drawback in using
          this device is that the hand should be steady while scanning;
          otherwise, it may distort the image. One of the commonly used handheld
          scanners is the barcode scanner which you would have seen in shopping
          stores./dd>
        </dd>

        <dt>iii) Sheetfed Scanner:</dt>
        <dd>
          In this scanner, the document is inserted into the slot provided in
          the scanner. The main components of this scanner include the
          sheet-feeder, scanning module, and calibration sheet. The light does
          not move in this scanner. Instead, the document moves through the
          scanner. It is suitable for scanning single page documents, not for
          thick objects like books, magazines, etc.
        </dd>

        <dt>iv) Drum Scanner:</dt>
        <dd>
          Drum scanner has a photomultiplier tube (PMT) to scan images. It does
          not have a charge-coupled device like a flatbed scanner. The
          photomultiplier tube is extremely sensitive to light. The image is
          placed on a glass tube, and the light moves across the image, which
          produces a reflection of the image which is captured by the PMT and
          processed. These scanners have high resolution and are suitable for
          detailed scans.
        </dd>

        <dt>v) Photo Scanner:</dt>
        <dd>
          It is designed to scan photographs. It has high resolution and color
          depth, which are required for scanning photographs. Some photo
          scanners come with in-built software for cleaning and restoring old
          photographs.
